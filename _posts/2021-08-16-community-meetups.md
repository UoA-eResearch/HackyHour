Come to our themed sessions and hear how researchers from across the University are using digital tools to collect and analyse their datasets. Meet other researchers working on the same field, and tell us what digital skills you would like to learn. Good food and vibes will be provided, stay on afterwards for a casual time in the common room!

## About the sessions

These sessions are designed so postgraduate students and researchers at the University of Auckland can come together and share digital research skills in an accessible way.

Each session will focus on a particular tool or data type: sometimes it’ll be an introduction and sometimes tips for the more adventurous users. Either way, it’ll be friendly and interactive. Sessions start with a quick presentation followed by an opportunity for the community to share their experiences and connect with others with similar interests or problems. Presenters are postgraduate students, researchers, and Centre for eResearch staff who wrangle these tools in the wild.
