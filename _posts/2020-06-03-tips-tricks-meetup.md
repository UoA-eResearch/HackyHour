Kia ora!

*Have you got messy research data that you wish you could tidy up faster?*

*Is Python scripting bringing you down?*

Join us for informal online Tools, Tips and Tricks Zoom Sessions over the next few weeks! It's a series of online meetups for researchers at the University of Auckland to come together and share digital research skills in a friendly and accessible way.

Each session will focus on a particular tool or data type. It will start with a quick presentation followed by an opportunity for all to share their experiences and connect with others with similar interests

The presentations will be made by postgraduate students and researchers who are working with the tools, and staff at Centre for eResearch who have worked with researchers using those tools.

These sessions will happen on the [Hacky Hour@Auckland Zoom meeting room](https://auckland.zoom.us/j/9328250646).
